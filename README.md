# PyBerlin Playwright Python demo

This is a demo of writing end-to-end tests using Playwright for Python and the Pytest test-runner.

Highlights:

- Using [Web-First Assertions](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/test-assertions) (retry until condition is met)
- Using the [official Pytest plugin](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/test-runners) for Playwright
- Enabled [Playwright Tracing](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/trace-viewer-intro) with retain-on-failure mode
- Running tests on [GitHub Actions](./.github/workflows/ci.yml)
